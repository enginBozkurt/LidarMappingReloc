1. Provide initial pose guess by wheel encoder odometry;
2. Save maps for re-visit localization;
3. Comparing the final pose estimate with VICON measurements, and observe how glass walls,
 moving objects and scene changes effect the localization accuracy;
4. Compress the 3D map into 2D format for movebase navigation and test waypoint navigation
 function (Current 3D lidar configuration is not suitable for realtime low-height obstable 
 avoision)
